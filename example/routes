# OTTO - ROUTES EXAMPLE

# Each route has three parts:
#  * HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE or HEAD)
#  * URI path
#  * Ruby class and method to call

GET   /                         App#index
POST  /                         App#receive_feedback
GET   /redirect                 App#redirect
GET   /robots.txt               App#robots_text
GET   /product/:prodid          App#display_product

GET   /bogus                    App#no_such_method

# You can also define these handlers when no 
# route can be found or there's a server error. (optional) 
GET   /404                      App#not_found
GET   /500                      App#server_error
