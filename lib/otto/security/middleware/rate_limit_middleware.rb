        # and then passes through all requests.
        #
        # To enforce rate limits, Rack::Attack must be added to the middleware
        # stack BEFORE Otto's router (typically done by the hosting application).
        #
        # Example (config.ru):
        #   use Rack::Attack  # Must come before Otto
        #   run otto
        #
        # The call method is a pass-through; rate limiting happens in Rack::Attack.
