#
# - initialization_spec.rb: Otto instantiation, configuration, and class methods
# - security_spec.rb: Security features, headers, middleware, and trusted proxies
# - routing_spec.rb: Request handling, routing, and error handling
# - uri_spec.rb: URI generation with comprehensive edge case coverage
# - file_safety_spec.rb: File and directory safety validation
# - utilities_spec.rb: Locale handling and other utility methods
