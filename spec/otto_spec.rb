# This file orchestrates the Otto test suite by including all organized test files.
# Individual test files are organized by functionality in the spec/otto/ directory:
#
# - initialization_spec.rb: Otto instantiation, configuration, and class methods
# - security_spec.rb: Security features, headers, middleware, and trusted proxies
# - routing_spec.rb: Request handling, routing, and error handling
# - uri_spec.rb: URI generation with comprehensive edge case coverage
# - file_safety_spec.rb: File and directory safety validation
# - utilities_spec.rb: Locale handling and other utility methods
# - enhanced_routing_spec.rb: Enhanced route parsing with key-value parameters
# - response_handlers_spec.rb: Response handler system unit tests
# - response_integration_spec.rb: Response handler integration tests
